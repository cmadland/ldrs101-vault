Welcome to Obsidian!

Obsidian is basically a note-taking tool, but it has MANY more features and capabilities that make it ideal for what is known as *Personal Knowledge Mastery* or PKM. Higher education isn't what it used to be, and you will be required to find and organize a massive amount of information during your time in higher ed. There is no possible way that you will be able to memorize and remember everything you need to be successful, and that is where Obsidian comes in.

If you set yourself up with a information workflow, you will never have to worry about not being able to find something because everything will be linked and fully searchable
