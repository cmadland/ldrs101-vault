Welcome to Obsidian!

Obsidian is basically a note-taking tool, but it has MANY more features and capabilities that make it ideal for what is known as *Personal Knowledge Mastery* or PKM. Higher education isn't what it used to be, and you will be required to find and organize a massive amount of information during your time in higher ed. There is no possible way that you will be able to memorize and remember everything you need to be successful, and that is where Obsidian comes in.

If you set yourself up with a information workflow, you will never have to worry about not being able to find something because everything will be linked and fully searchable.

What you are looking at right now is little more than a simple folder of plain text files sitting on your computer. Obsidian calls this folder a `vault`. These files are written using a very simple formatting language called `markdown`, which uses common punctuation marks to tell a web browser or program like Obsidian how to style text. For example, if I want to use *italics*, then, instead of clicking a button in a word processor, all you do is surround the text with a pair of asterisks, like this `*italics*`.

Obsidian provides a simple way to view those files as if they were a website. You can add links from one file to another, or out to the web; you can also add images and other media. It is for this reason that Obsidian is a great way to learn about how the internet works, but, because the files are only on your computer, your content can't be accessed by anyone else (unless you do some extra work to publish your site).

Another great way to use Obsidian is to create a set of inter-connected notes. You will learn to do this during the first half of this course, then you will apply some of that knowledge towards building an actual website in WordPress in the second half of the course.
